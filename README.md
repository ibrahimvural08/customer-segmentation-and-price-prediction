📊 Customer Segmentation & Price Prediction System

End-to-end data science project that analyzes UK supermarket data to perform customer segmentation and product price prediction using machine learning techniques. The project also includes an interactive web interface for basket optimization.

🚀 Project Overview

This project combines data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning modeling, and web application deployment.

It aims to:

Predict future product prices using Linear Regression

Segment customers/products using K-Means Clustering

Optimize shopping baskets using simulation techniques

Provide an interactive Streamlit web interface
